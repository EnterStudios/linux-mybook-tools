FAQ

Does this proceedure permanently decrypt my disk?

    No. It only sets up a filter, so that the linux system can see through the encryption.
    When you reboot, the filter is gone, and you have to recreate it. Save your dek.hex
    (and if necessary rev4.ko or rev16.ko). Better yet, backup your files before you
    turn the computer off.
