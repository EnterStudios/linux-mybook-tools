FAQ

Does this proceedure permanently decrypt my disk?

    No. It only sets up a filter, so that the linux system can see through the encryption.
    When you reboot, the filter is gone, and you have to recreate it. Save your dek.hex
    (and if necessary rev4.ko or rev16.ko). Better yet, backup your files before you
    turn the computer off.

Will it work in a virtual machine (VM) running linux?

    I don't know. No one has told me that it has worked for them. You will need to be
    able to access the WD drive, but some VM software do not allow that.

Will it work if I use a live linux USB?

    It's never guaranteed to work, but a live USB linux system is fine for this.
